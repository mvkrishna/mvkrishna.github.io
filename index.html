          DPOD is a full reliability-centered maintenance application that improves site operations and
          profitability through consolidation of work activities, optimization of daily schedules, maintenance
          of
          historical records, and automation of standardized reporting. The application simplifies daily site
          operations, reduces operating costs, and increases worker productivity. Features include
          consolidated task
          management, automated scheduling, integration with ESCADA and Diagnostics for automatic unplanned
          task
          creation and real-time turbine status (contingent upon purchase), a simplified summary of key data
          for
          daily operations, and standardized reporting and communication. Benefits include improved site
          efficiency,
          smart planning, and enhanced production. The application is powered by the Predix platform and
          incorporates tasks and data from various sources, including SCADA, PulsePOINT, punchlists, emails,
          and
          weather, to manage all site tasks. It also utilizes an advanced planning algorithm to recommend an
          optimized schedule for each day based on site-specific attributes.

        <p>
          The problem that Documiner aims to address is the difficulty in searching through text-based documents
          that are scanned or in image format. This can be a time-consuming and tedious task, especially if the
          documents are long or there are many of them.
          <br>
          Documiner is a python-based service that can extract files of any format from a configured box folder and
          process them using AWS Textract. Textract is a machine learning service that can extract text and data
          from a variety of document types, including scanned documents and images.
          <br>
          The service is accompanied by a simple desktop app that allows users to search for a particular text
          or clause within the extracted documents. The app would allow users to view the files, search for a
          specific text or clause within single or multiple files, and drill down to a particular page within a
          file. The app would also have the ability to highlight the searched content within the document.
          <br>
          This solution would provide a number of benefits. It would improve automation and productivity by
          streamlining the process of searching through text-based documents. It would also be reusable for a
          variety of use cases, such as job scans, invoices, contracts, and technical documents. Additionally, it
          is cost-effective and provide a more efficient way to search through large numbers of documents.

          Auto Entry is a touchless entry system designed to streamline the process of entering GE premises. It utilizes
          a combination of QR code recognition, facial recognition, and profile validation to allow for self-declaration
          and form submission. The system also has the ability to generate forms and capture digital signatures, as well
          as manage user access and create dynamic rules for registration. Additionally, it provides an entry dashboard
          with reports on the use of the system.

          A Service that allows interaction with users through a conversational service such as Twilio. It processes
          messages, logs data to a DynamoDB database, and responds back to the user. This function can be used to create
          workflows with intents, slots, and actions, and can interact with multiple devices and apps. It aims to
          improve automation and productivity, and can be reused for a variety of use cases. Its use of a serverless,
          pay-per-use model makes it a cost-effective solution.
