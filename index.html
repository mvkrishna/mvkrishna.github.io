				<h5>Documiner</h5>
				<p>
					<small>
						The problem that Documiner aims to address is the difficulty in searching through
						text-based documents
						that are scanned or in image format. This can be a time-consuming and tedious task,
						especially if the
						documents are long or there are many of them.
						<br>
						Documiner is a python-based service that can extract files of any format from a
						configured box folder and
						process them using AWS Textract. Textract is a machine learning service that can extract
						text and data
						from a variety of document types, including scanned documents and images.
						<br>
						The service is accompanied by a simple desktop app that allows users to search for a
						particular text
						or clause within the extracted documents. The app would allow users to view the files,
						search for a
						specific text or clause within single or multiple files, and drill down to a particular
						page within a
						file. The app would also have the ability to highlight the searched content within the
						document.
						<br>
						This solution would provide a number of benefits. It would improve automation and
						productivity by
						streamlining the process of searching through text-based documents. It would also be
						reusable for a
						variety of use cases, such as job scans, invoices, contracts, and technical documents.
						Additionally, it
						is cost-effective and provide a more efficient way to search through large numbers of
						documents.

						A Service that allows interaction with users through a conversational service such as
						Twilio. It processes
						messages, logs data to a DynamoDB database, and responds back to the user. This function
						can be used to create
						workflows with intents, slots, and actions, and can interact with multiple devices and
						apps. It aims to
						improve automation and productivity, and can be reused for a variety of use cases. Its
						use of a serverless,
						pay-per-use model makes it a cost-effective solution.
